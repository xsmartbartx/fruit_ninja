# Fruit Ninja Auto Clicker

**Fruit Ninja Auto Clicker** is a simple Python script designed as an experimental tool to automatically generate points in the Fruit Ninja game. The project explores automation techniques and basic interaction logic in Python.

## 📌 Project Purpose

This repository contains a Python program intended to simulate automatic fruit slicing in the Fruit Ninja game, effectively acting as a basic auto-clicker to increase score without manual input. It is primarily for **learning and experimentation** rather than competitive use. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🧠 How It Works

- The script is written in **Python**  
- It likely employs keyboard/mouse automation libraries (e.g., `pyautogui`) to simulate clicks or interactions  
- Designed as a proof of concept for game automation techniques

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed  
2. Install dependencies (if any), for example:
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogui
   ```
   ```bash
   python "fruit ninja.py"
   ```

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

This script is intended for educational purposes only

Automating interaction with games may violate terms of service or fair play policies

Use responsibly and within legal/ethical boundaries

## 💡 Possible Improvements

Add configuration options (e.g., delay, click pattern)

Add logging and visual feedback

Package as a CLI tool with arguments
